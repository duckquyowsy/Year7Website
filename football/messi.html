    <p class="player_info">
      Lionel Messi is considered one of the best footballers in the word, some people even think he is the best in the world (like me). He has only ever been to 3
      football clubs in his life! Number 1: Barcelona FC. Number 2: Paris Saint Germain. Number 3: Inter Miami. He is rivals with Cristiano Ronaldo, because people
      are debating over who is better. Messi is an Argentine and has helped them to win the 2022 Fifa World Cup.
