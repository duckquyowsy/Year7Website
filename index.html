    <p class="info">
      This website was made by Owais Akhtar in 7A 23/24 in Mr Higgins' computing class. A fun fact about me is that
      I love coding and computers and I love to create games using a game engine called 'Unity'. I have made several
      games using this such as a minecraft game, an fps game, a zombie appocalypse, a topdown shooter and many more.
      The coding language used primarily in Unity is C#.
